This repository documents my work and learning throughout **MECE 4606 – Digital Manufacturing** at Columbia University. In this course, I explore how digital models are translated directly into physical objects using a range of computer-controlled manufacturing processes. My work focuses on building a strong connection between computational design and fabrication by using programming and CAD tools to generate manufacturable geometry, control fabrication parameters, and evaluate how design decisions affect real-world production.

Across the assignments in this repository, I work with multiple digital manufacturing workflows including additive manufacturing, CNC and 2D cutting processes, as well as algorithmic and parametric design methods. I use code to generate and modify geometry, automate layout and fabrication logic, and experiment with generative and data-driven approaches to design. I also engage with topics such as topology optimization, digital assembly concepts, machine control, and geometric representations used for manufacturing.

More broadly, this repository reflects my ongoing development of practical fabrication skills—such as preparing files for different machines, understanding material and process constraints, and iterating designs based on physical results—while also considering the broader technical, economic, and environmental implications of digital manufacturing systems.
